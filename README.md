# Pete's plumbing & gas Ltd 

Deployed website can be found [here](https://malc-u.github.io/petes-plumbing/)

## Project purpose
This is a website for a small plumbing & heating company in East Anglia. It is created to enhance company's visibility on the market by creating online presence. It will allow customers and potential customers to learn about services provided and convince them to choose this company over competition. 
The website is dedicated mostly for individual clients. 

#### External userâ€™s goal:
The site users are people planning upgrades and renovation of their homes in the future and/or individuals looking for services they require now. They all wish to learn more about company and services provided and possibly book an appointment or hear back from the company.

#### Site owner's goal:
The business owner wants to inform potential clients about the services and convince them to chose their services over ones provided by the competition.

## UX
Vast majority of users will be individuals who require plumbing and heating services in near future. People visiting this page will not be looking for ideas or asking themselves a question "if" they are going to go ahead with the planned investment. In plumbing & heating industry this is mostly checked on pages like Pintrest etc. where ideas can be looked up. 
Page users will be researching "which" company they are going to choose to carry out their planned investment.

Taking this into consideration this website is designed to assure them about professionalism and affordability (this confirmed in the reviews, gas safe membership and free inspections provided by the company).  
Welcome page contains a picture of company's plumber/gas engineer at work - which enhances trust in the company, especially to returning customers that will recognize the person and will instantly know it is the person that visited them. 
Color scheme was intentionally limited to enhance red and blue that are commonly regarded as associated with plumbing and/or hot and cold water.

## Functionality

It is written in HTML and CSS, however some Java Script was added to enhance the user experience. It is a single scrolling page with 5 separate page areas with navigation bar and footer. 
Although there is a contact form within this page it will not work as there are no back end functions incorporated in the code.
