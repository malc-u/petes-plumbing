# Pete's plumbing & gas Ltd 

Deployed website can be found [here](https://malc-u.github.io/petes-plumbing/)

## Project purpose
This is a website for a small plumbing & heating company in East Anglia. It is created to enhance company's visibility on the market by creating online presence. It will allow customers and potential customers to learn about services provided and convince them to choose this company over competition. 
The website is dedicated mostly for individual clients. 

#### External userâ€™s goal:
The site users are people planning upgrades and renovation of their homes in the future and/or individuals looking for services they require now. They all wish to learn more about company and services provided and possibly book an appoitment.

#### Site owner's goal:
The business owner wants to inform potential clients about the services and convince them to chose their servies over ones provided by the competition.

## UX
Vast majority of the users will be individuals who require plumbing and heating services in near future. People visiting this page will not be looking for ideas or asking themselves a question "if" they are going to go ahead with the planned investment. In plumbing & heating industry this is mostly checked on pages like Pintrest etc. where ideas can be looked up. 
Page users will be researching "which" company they are going to choose to carry out their planned investment.

Taking this into consideartion this website is designed to assure them about professionalism and affordability (this confirmed in the reviews and gas safe memebership).

## Functionality
This project utilises Bootstrap framework and Bootswatch Journal theme as a base to create one/scrolling page with Mobile first approach. This website is within the mandatory guidelines. It is written in HTML and CSS, however some Java Script was added to enhance the user experience. It is a single scrolling page with 5 separate page areas with navigation bar and footer. 
Although there is a contact form within this page it will not work as there are no back end fuctions incorporated in the code.
The front end of this website, ie. fonts, cards etc were imported into this project from Bootswatch theme [Journal](https://bootswatch.com/journal/).
